to use a constant
	var1 = tf.constant("Hello World")
	sess.run(var1)

to use non constant 
	x = tf.placeholder(tf.string)
	sess.run(x,feed_dict={x:'hello world'})
	
Applied the tf.add(), tf.subtract(), tf.multiply(), and tf.divide() functions using numeric data.
Learned about casting between types with tf.cast(x,tf.int32)

tf.placeholder() and tf.constant(), since those Tensors can't be modified. This is where tf.Variable class comes in.
This tensor stores its state in the session, so you must initialize the state of the tensor manually. 
You'll use the tf.global_variables_initializer() function to initialize the state of all the Variable tensors.

Randomizing the weights helps the model from becoming stuck in the same place every time you train it. 
You'll use the tf.truncated_normal() function to generate random numbers from a normal distribution.

The tf.reduce_sum() function takes an array of numbers and sums them together.
tf.log()
